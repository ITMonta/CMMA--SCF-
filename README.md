# CMMA--SCF-
#a desktop application
that allows the employees to create new clothing range and
calculate production time to pick the best options based on 
the clothing variants and their operations time that they have
on the database and they can also add or update any of those 
from the new variant layer. 
# the goal of this application is to reduce the waste of time that employees 
 spend on paperwork (and also to reduce the risk of mistake )
